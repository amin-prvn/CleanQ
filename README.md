# CleanQ
 We all have to go to a clinic once in a while (hopefully, only for a routine checkup), and we all hate having to sit there waiting until itâ€™s our turn. (not to mention now that we have a pandemic going on, waiting in a crowded place may be really dangerous!). So, once again we want to use technology to solve a problem! CleanQ (clearly a play on Clinic and a Clean Queue), aims to create a platform in which clinics can sign up to accept patients, and patients can make reservations on clinics.
